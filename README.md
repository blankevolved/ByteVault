You can get data, (kb, mb, gb)

You can sell data to get C-BUCKS

To get data you will use your computers components

Components:
1. CPU (generates data every x seconds)
2. RAM (better the ram the lower x seconds is)
3. GPU (not sure yet, maybe used to convert the data into C-BUCKS)
4. STORAGE DEVICE (SSD, HDD, FLOPPY DISKS)
